## Welcome to Me

The gist of it:

- I like to collaborate on OSS projects
- I like Node.js and JavaScript
- I used to be a hipster
- Now I'm somebody's dad
- I live in a bedroom community
- Cannot stop putting two spaces after a period
- Weirdo & curmudgeon

Current status:

- Hacking on [hardened JavaScript](https://hardenedjs.org): [LavaMoat](/LavaMoat/LavaMoat) & [Endo](/endojs/endo)
- A self-indulgent rewrite of [midnight-smoker](/boneskull/midnight-smoker) which essentially lints package tarballs. This questionable effort has spawned some tools:
  - [xstate-audition](/boneskull/xstate-audition), a test helper for [XState](/statelyai/xstate)
  - [impvol](/boneskull/impvol), a thing that lets you `import()` modules in Node.js from [memfs](streamich/memfs)' virtual filesystems
- I sometimes grace [JS Party](https://jsparty.fm) with my casual elegance and unbridled optimism
